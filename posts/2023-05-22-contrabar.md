In this blog post I'll explain my paper _ContraBAR: Contrastive Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL_, written under the supervision of Professor Aviv Tamar.
This post assumes a basic working knowledge of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Machine Learning.

We'll begin by understanding the potential of Meta RL and fast adaptation in RL. From there we'll continue to _POMDPs_ and _information states_, followed by our algorithmic and theoretic contribution.

# What is the potential of Meta RL?
